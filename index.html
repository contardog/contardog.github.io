I do some machine learning and data-mining on some astro-data. Sometimes, I make pretty plots too. Also interested in biology applications, among other things. You can find more information in the tabs above.

I am a Flatiron Research Fellow at the Center for Computational Astrophysics, Simons Foundation, NY (joined in July 2018). Before that, I did my PhD in Computer Science and Machine Learning at Sorbonne Universite in Paris, France.

I work at the intersection between <b>Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Astrophysics/Astronomy</b>. I develop Machine Learning and Data Mining tools to provide new insights on data, to help deepen our understanding and to potentially discover unknown or unexplained properties of the data and their underlying physics. Most recently, I have spent time working on <b>finding and characterizing gaps</b> in datasets, inspired by Topological Data Analysis. I am also interested in <b>representation learning</b> methods for tasks such as class-discovery, anomaly detection, and one-class classification, applied on complex data such as time-series or graphs/sets. I also spend time thinking about interpretability and understandability of Machine/Deep Learning methods for scientific discovery. I am interested in other fields of applications as well, such as computational and structural biology (e.g. for drug discovery), healthcare and medical, and neuroscience, among other things.

I actually look like this:

More likely like that when things no work

I also share some fashion style with this dog:
