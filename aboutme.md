**Newer news**: I am now a SMASH-MSCA fellow at the University of Nova Gorica (Slovenia), at the Center for Astrophysics and Cosmology, since September 2024.

Sept 22: I moved! I am now a Research Fellow at SISSA (Trieste, Italy) in the Theoretical and Scientific Data Science group since September 2022.

From July 2018 to July 2022, I was Flatiron Research Fellow at the Center for Computational Astrophysics, Simons Foundation, NY. Before that, I did my PhD in Computer Science and Machine Learning at Sorbonne Universite in Paris, France.

I work at the intersection between **Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Astrophysics/Astronomy**. I develop Machine Learning and Data Mining tools to provide new insights on data, to help deepen our understanding and to potentially discover unknown or unexplained properties of the data and their underlying physics. Most recently, I have spent time working on **finding and characterizing gaps** (i.e. under-densities) in datasets, inspired by Topological Data Analysis. I am also interested in **representation learning** methods for tasks such as class-discovery, anomaly detection, and one-class classification, applied on complex data such as time-series. I also spend time thinking about interpretability and understandability of Machine/Deep Learning methods for scientific discovery.
I woud love to learn more about other fields of applications as well, such as computational and structural biology (e.g. for drug discovery), healthcare, and neuroscience, among other things.



You can find my Google Scholar list of publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zUNlxp4AAAAJ&hl=en%), my resume above and hopefully more information on my research somewhere in blog notes, at some point?! 

I actually look like this:

More likely like that when things no work

I share some fashion style with this dog:
